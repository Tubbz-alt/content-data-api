# ADR 001: Audit plan to model audit data

24-08-2017
 
## Context

1. Discrepancies in the expected numbers of content items that need to be audited when we compare them with the existing spreadsheets. 
2. Themes do not represent the input of an Audit.

## Decision

1. Introduce the notion of an `Audit Plan` that models the input of an audit.
2. Do not use Themes in the Content Audit Tool, and rely on primary organisations.

## Status

Accepted
