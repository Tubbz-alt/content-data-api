This guide introduces the Content Performance API.

All examples use [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) for interfacing with the API on
the command line. You may prefer the structured output of using [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/)
or piping the curl responses through [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

GOV.UK Content API is accessed via [HTTP][] and returns data in a [JSON][]
format. The [reference documentation](reference.html) provides a thorough
overview of the endpoints and the response format.

## What you can do with this API

This API provides access to metrics about the performance of GOV.UK content.
Each metric is a time series, so you can see how the content performance has
changed over time.

## What you can't do with this API

This API does not expose the content itself. For that you should use the [GOV.UK Content API][].

Not all content is available. For example, content that is generated
dynamically (such as through a search) is not available.

## Getting Started

To query the API you need to know the content ID for the piece of content you
are interested in.

You can find out the content ID for most GOV.UK pages using the [GOV.UK Content API][].

For example

```shell
curl https://www.gov.uk/api/content/vat-rates
```

Then you can use the `/metrics/[content-id]` endpoint to query the number of page views:

```shell
http://content-performance-manager.dev.gov.uk/api/v1/metrics/f838c22a-b2aa-49be-bd95-153f593293a3?from=2018-02-28&to=2018-02-28&metric=pageviews
```

The `from` and `to` query parameters specify the date range to query.

## Alpha software

GOV.UK Content Performance API is currently alpha software and is likely to
change significantly between versions.

This means that you may use the API and build applications that use
it, but live services should not rely on it.

As we learn from feedback we may make changes to the software.
We will communicate those via our [mailing list](#keep-informed).

## Keep informed

We intend to use a mailing list to communicate any breaking changes or updates to
the support status of this API. This will be linked from this documentation.

## Authentication

Usage of GOV.UK Content Performance API currently requires authentication using an OAuth2 bearer token. Please [contact the team](#support) first if you are interested in using the API.

To authenticate, include an Authorization header like the following:

```
Authorization: Bearer your-token-here
```

## Security and compliance

### Reporting vulnerabilities

If you believe there is a security issue with GOV.UK Content Performance API, please
[contact us immediately](#support).

Please donâ€™t disclose the suspected breach publicly until it has been fixed.

### HTTPS

GOV.UK Content Performance API follows government HTTPS security guidelines. The
Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), which involves the Transport Layer
Security (TLS) protocol, is used by the platform to provide secure connections.

## Rate limiting

There is a maximum limit of 10 requests per second per client. If you exceed
this your request won't be processed until the limit is no longer exceeded
and you may see timeout errors.

We think this should be sufficient for all users of GOV.UK Content Performance API but
if you believe you need the limit increasing you can [contact support](#support).
